TMTextSpdc[]=[3,0x2478EC,The TECHNICAL MACHINE I handed you contains [move].\p… … … … … …]
TMTextSpdc[]=[4,0x243165,TATE: That TM04 contains... LIZA: [move]!\pTATE: It’s a move that’s perfect... LIZA: For any POKéMON!\p… … … … … …]
TMTextSpdc[]=[5,0x214BC1,All my POKéMON does is [move]... No one dares to come near me...\pSigh... If you would, please take this TM away...]
TMTextSpdc[]=[5,0x214BE3,TM05 contains [move].]
TMTextSpdc[]=[8,0x21EF08,That TM08 contains [move].\p… … … … … …]
TMTextSpdc[]=[9,0x20F620,I like filling my mouth with seeds, then spitting them out fast!\pI like you, so you can have this!\pUse it on a POKéMON, and it will learn [move].\pWhat does that have to do with firing seeds? Well, nothing!]
TMTextSpdc[]=[24,0x201D42,WATTSON: Wahahahaha!\pI knew it, \v01\v05! I knew I’d made the right choice asking you!\pThis is my thanks - a TM containing [move]!\pGo on, you’ve earned it!]
TMTextSpdc[]=[31,0x24927B,TM31 contains [move]! It’s a move so horrible that I can’t describe it.]
TMTextSpdc[]=[34,0x2306EC,That TM34 there contains [move]. You can count on it!\p… … … … … …]
TMTextSpdc[]=[39,0x235797,That TM39 contains [move].\pIf you use a TM, it instantly teaches the move to a POKéMON.\pRemember, a TM can be used only once, so think before you use it.]
TMTextSpdc[]=[40,0x238E73,TM40 contains [move].\p… … … … … …]
TMTextSpdc[]=[41,0x22B16C,That’s, like, TM41, you know? Hey, it’s [move], you hearing me?\pHey, now, you listen here, like, I’m not laying a torment on you!]
TMTextSpdc[]=[42,0x2275EE,DAD: TM42 contains [move].\pIt might be able to turn a bad situation into an advantage.]
TMTextSpdc[]=[47,0x250692,STEVEN: Okay, thank you.\pYou went through all this trouble to deliver that. I need to thank you.\pLet me see... I’ll give you this TM.\pIt contains my favorite move, [move].]
TMTextSpdc[]=[50,0x220ECE,That TM50 contains [move].]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[4,0x2EAE19,Sigh…\pSOOTOPOLIS’s GYM LEADER is really lovably admirable.\pBut that also means I have many rivals for his attention.\pHe’s got appeal with a [move]. I couldn’t even catch his eye.\pPlease, let me teach your POKéMON the move [move]!]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[4,0x2EAE3C,Okay, which POKéMON should I teach [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[15,0x2EADB1,I can’t do this anymore!\pIt’s utterly hopeless!\pI’m a FIGHTING-type TRAINER, so I can’t win at the MOSSDEEP GYM no matter how hard I try!\pArgh! Punch! Punch! Punch! Punch! Punch! Punch!\pWhat, don’t look at me that way! I’m only hitting the ground!\pOr do you want me to teach your POKéMON [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[15,0x2EAE04,I want you to win at the MOSSDEEP GYM using that [move]!]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[12,0x2EAE81,I don’t intend to be going nowhere fast in the sticks like this forever.\pYou watch me, I’ll get out to the city and become a huge hit.\pSeriously, I’m going to cause a huge explosion of popularity!\pIf you overheard that, I’ll happily teach [move] to your POKéMON!]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[12,0x2EAEA4,Fine! [move] it is! Which POKéMON wants to learn it?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[12,0x2EAED4,For a long time, I’ve taught POKéMON how to use [move], but I’ve yet to ignite my own explosion…\pMaybe it’s because deep down, I would rather stay here…]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[29,0x2EABA9,There’s a move that is wickedly cool.\pIt’s called [move].\nWant me to teach it to a POKéMON?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[8,0x2EAC79,I want all sorts of things! But I used up my allowance…\pWouldn’t it be nice if there were a spell that made money appear when you waggle a finger?\pIf you want, I can teach your POKéMON the move [move].\pMoney won’t appear, but your POKéMON will do well in battle. Yes?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[8,0x2EACCC,When a POKéMON uses [move], all sorts of nice things happen.]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[7,0x2EAC11,Ah, young one!\pI am also a young one, but I mimic the styles and speech of the elderly folks of this town.\pWhat do you say, young one? Would you agree to it if I were to offer to teach the move [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[7,0x2EAC64,[move] is a move of great depth.\pCould you execute it to perfection as well as me…?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[7,0x2EAC5A,Oh, boo! I wanted to teach [move] to your POKéMON!]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[16,0x2EAB41,Did you know that you can go from here a long way in that direction without changing direction?\pI might even be able to roll that way.\pDo you think your POKéMON will want to roll, too?\pI can teach one the move [move] if you’d like.]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[24,0x2EACE1,Humph! My wife relies on HIDDEN POWER to stay awake.\pShe should just take a nap like I do.\pI can teach your POKéMON how to [move]. Interested?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[24,0x2EAD34,I’ve never once gotten my wife’s coin trick right.\pI would be happy if I got it right even as I teach [move]…]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[14,0x2EAD49,When I see the wide world from up here on the roof…\pI think about how nice it would be if there were more than just one me so I could enjoy all sorts of lives.\pOf course it’s not possible. Giggle…\pI know! Would you be interested in having a POKéMON learn [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[14,0x2EAD6C,Giggle… Which POKéMON do you want me to teach [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[14,0x2EAD92,Oh, no?\pA POKéMON can do well in a battle using it, you know.]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[25,0x2EAA9F,Heh! My POKéMON totally rules! It’s cooler than any POKéMON!\pI was lipping off with a swagger in my step like that when the CHAIRMAN chewed me out.\pThat took the swagger out of my step.\pIf you’d like, I’ll teach the move [move] to a POKéMON of yours.]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[25,0x2EAAC2,All right, which POKéMON wants to learn how to [move]?]
MoveTutorTextSpdc[]=[25,0x2EAB2C,I’ll just praise my POKéMON from now on without the [move].]
